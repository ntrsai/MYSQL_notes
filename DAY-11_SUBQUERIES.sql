Subqueries:
Definition:
A subquery, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a query embedded within another SQL query. 
It is enclosed in parentheses and can be used in various clauses such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. 
Subqueries can return a single value, a single row, or a set of rows.

Purpose:
Subqueries are used to perform operations that require multiple steps or to filter results based on the 
results of another query. They can simplify complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, 
more manageable parts. Subqueries can also be used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query, 
allowing for more dynamic and flexible SQL statements.

Types of Subqueries:
1. Single-row subquery: Returns a single row and can be used with comparison operators.
2. Multiple-row subquery: Returns multiple rows and can be used with operators like IN, ANY, or ALL.
3. Scalar subquery: Returns a single value (one column, one row) and can be used in expressions.
4. Correlated subquery:
Examples:

1. Single-row subquery:

   - Purpose: To find employees whose salary is greater than the average salary.
   
   SELECT EmployeeID, Name
   FROM Employees
   WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees); 
   
2. Multiple-row subquery:

Purpose: To find employees who work in departments with a budget greater than $100,000.

SELECT EmployeeID, Name
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE Budget > 100000);

3. Scalar subquery:

Purpose: To find the name of the employee with the highest salary.

SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees);

4. Correlated subquery:

Purpose: To find employees whose salary is above the average salary of their respective departments.

SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees WHERE DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID);

subqueries are a powerful feature in SQL that allow for more complex and dynamic queries by enabling the use 
of the results of one query within another. They can help simplify SQL statements and make them more readable 
and maintainable.
