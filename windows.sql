-- Window Functions
/*
Definition:
Window functions are a type of SQL function that perform calculations across a set of table rows
that are somehow related to the current row. Unlike regular aggregate functions, which return a single
value for a group of rows, window functions return a value for each row in the result set.

Key Characteristics:
1. They do not collapse rows; each row retains its identity.
2. They are often used for running totals, moving averages, ranking, and other calculations
that require access to multiple rows.

Types of Window Functions :
1. Aggregate Functions: These functions perform calculations across a set of rows and return a single value.
Examples include SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), etc.

2. Ranking Functions: These functions assign a rank to each row within a partition of a result set.
Examples include ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and DENSE_RANK().

3. Value Functions: These functions return a value from a specific row in the result set.
Examples include LEAD(), LAG(), FIRST_VALUE(), and LAST_VALUE().

4. Analytic Functions: These functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row,
similar to aggregate functions but without collapsing the result set. Examples include NTILE().

The general syntax for a window function is as follows:
function_name(column_name) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
    [ORDER BY order_expression]
    [ROWS or RANGE frame_specification]
)

Note ---
Window functions are powerful tools in SQL that enable advanced data analysis without losing
the context of individual rows. They are particularly useful in reporting and analytical queries.
