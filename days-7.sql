What Are Operators in MySQL?

Operators in MySQL are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on one or more operands 
(values, expressions, or fields) in a MySQL query. They are essential for forming conditions, manipulating data, 
'and retrieving desired results from the database. Operators help in computations, comparisons, logical evaluations,
string concatenations, and much more.


1. Arithmetic Operators

+: Addition
-: Subtraction
*: Multiplication
/: Division
%: Modulus (remainder after division)
DIV: Integer division (returns integer part of division)
MOD: Modulus (same as % in MySQL)


2. Comparison Operators

=: Equal to
<> or !=: Not equal to
>: Greater than
<: Less than
>=: Greater than or equal to
<=: Less than or equal to
LIKE: Pattern matching using wildcards (% and _)
NOT LIKE: Pattern not matching
REGEXP: Regular expression matching
NOT REGEXP: Regular expression not matching


3. Logical Operators

AND: Logical AND (true if both conditions are true)
OR: Logical OR (true if at least one condition is true)
NOT: Logical NOT (negates the condition)
XOR: Logical exclusive OR (true if only one condition is true)


4. Assignment Operators

=: Assign a value to a variable or column
:=: Assign a value to a user-defined variable
+=: Addition assignment (not standard in MySQL but used in some cases)
-=: Subtraction assignment
*=: Multiplication assignment
/=: Division assignment
%=: Modulus assignment
DIV=: Integer division assignment
MOD=: Modulus assignment


5. Bitwise Operators

&: Bitwise AND
|: Bitwise OR
^: Bitwise XOR
~: Bitwise NOT (inverts the bits)
<<: Left shift
>>: Right shift


6. String Operators

CONCAT(): Concatenate strings (e.g., CONCAT('Hello', ' World'))
||: String concatenation (alternative to CONCAT in some MySQL versions)


7. Other Operators

IN: Membership test (checks if a value exists in a list or subquery)
NOT IN: Membership test (checks if a value does not exist in a list or subquery)
BETWEEN: Range test (checks if a value is within a range)
NOT BETWEEN: Range test (checks if a value is outside a range)
IS NULL: Null test (checks if a value is NULL)
IS NOT NULL: Null test (checks if a value is not NULL)
EXISTS: Subquery test (true if subquery returns any rows)
NOT EXISTS: Subquery test (true if subquery returns no rows)

Why Are Operators Important in MySQL?
Simplify Query Logic: Operators make it easy to specify conditions and manipulate data directly in SQL statements.
Dynamic Data Retrieval: Help fetch specific records based on comparisons and logical conditions.
Data Manipulation: Arithmetic and string operators allow dynamic computation and formatting of data.
Efficient Filtering: Operators like LIKE and BETWEEN enable precise filtering for large datasets.

These operators cover a wide range of functionality, from basic arithmetic to advanced logical and 
string manipulations, enabling efficient data handling and querying in MySQL.

-- Bitwise operators

/*
Get Binary Number -

-------512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2,1

Binary of 5 is - 0101
Binary of 3 is - 0011

Common Bitwise Operators in MySQL
AND (&): Compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 only where both bits are 1.
OR (|): Compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 where at least one of the bits
is 1.
XOR (^): Compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 where the bits are different.
NOT (~): Inverts the bits of a number.
Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.
Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.

Bitwise operators can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

1. Flags and Permissions: Using bitwise operations to manage user permissions or feature flags.
2. Data Compression: Storing multiple boolean values in a single integer.
3. Efficient Calculations: Performing low-level data manipulation or optimizations.

Let's say we have a table called users that stores user permissions as a bitmask.
Each permission corresponds to a specific bit in an integer:

1 (0001) - Read permission
2 (0010) - Write permission
4 (0100) - Execute permission
8 (1000) - Delete permission

WHERE condition;
