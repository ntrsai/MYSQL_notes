-- pattern & Regular Expressions
/*
Regular expressions (regex) in MySQL are used to search for patterns in strings. 
MySQL provides the REGEXP operator, which allows you to perform pattern matching using regular 
expressions. This can be particularly useful for validating input, searching for specific formats, 
or filtering data based on patterns.

/*

1. Views
Definition: A view is a virtual table in a database that is based on the result of a SELECT query.
It does not store data itself but provides a way to present data from one or more tables in a
structured format. Views can simplify complex queries, enhance security by restricting access to
specific data, and provide a consistent interface to data.

Key Features of Views
1. Simplification: Views can simplify complex queries by encapsulating them.
2. Security: They can restrict access to specific rows or columns of data.
3. Reusability: Once created, views can be reused in other queries.

*/


-- Example 1: Employee Management System

-- Step 1: Create the Employee table
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    position VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    active BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);

-- Step 2: Insert sample data into Employees
INSERT INTO Employee (name, position, active, status) VALUES
('John Doe', 'Manager', TRUE, 'active'),
('Jane Smith', 'Developer', TRUE, 'active'),
('Bob Johnson', 'Designer', FALSE, 'inactive');

select * from employee;

-- Step 3: Create a view for active employees
CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS
SELECT id, name, position
FROM Employee
WHERE active = 1;

-- Step 4: Use the view
SELECT * FROM EmployeeView;

-- Step 5: Update the view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ActiveEmployees AS
SELECT id, name, position
FROM Employee
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Step 6: Use the updated view
SELECT * FROM ActiveEmployees;

-- Step 7: Delete the view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS EmployeeView;

-- Optionally, delete the updated view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS ActiveEmployees;


-- Example 2: Product Management System
-- Step 1: Create the Products Table
CREATE TABLE Products (

    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,

-- Step 3: Create a View for Available Products
CREATE VIEW AvailableProducts AS
SELECT id, name, price, stock
FROM Products
WHERE stock > 0;

-- Step 4: Use the View
SELECT * FROM AvailableProducts;

-- Step 5: Update the View to Include Category
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW AvailableProductsWithCategory AS
SELECT id, name, price, stock, category

WHERE stock > 0;

-- Step 6: Use the Updated View
SELECT * FROM AvailableProductsWithCategory;

-- Step 7: Delete the Views

-- Example 3: Order Management System
-- Step 1: Create the Orders Table

('Charlie', 3, 1, '2023-10-03'),
('David', 1, 3, '2023-10-04');

-- Step 3: Create a View for Order Summary
CREATE VIEW OrderSummary AS
SELECT o.id, o.customer_name, p.name AS product_name, o.quantity, o.order_date
FROM Orders o
JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.id;

-- Step 4: Use the View
SELECT * FROM OrderSummary;

-- Step 5: Update the View to Include Total Price
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW OrderSummaryWithTotal AS
SELECT o.id, o.customer_name, p.name AS product_name, o.quantity, o.order_date,
       (o.quantity * p.price) AS total_price

-- Step 6: Use the Updated View
SELECT * FROM OrderSummaryWithTotal;

-- Step 7: Delete the Views
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS OrderSummary;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS OrderSummaryWithTotal;


/*
2. Common Table Expressions (CTE)
Definition:
A CTE is a temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
It is defined using the WITH clause.

Key Features of CTEs
1. Readability: CTEs can make complex queries easier to read and maintain.
2. Recursion: CTEs can be recursive, allowing for hierarchical data traversal.
3. Modularity: They can be defined once and referenced multiple times within the same query.
